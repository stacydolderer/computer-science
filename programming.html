                    <h2>Welcome to Intro to Comptuer Programming</h2>
                    <p>This is a course about the practice of programming, an attempt to expose students to the development of real programs. Programming is more than just writing code. Programmers must also assess tradeoffs, choose among design alternatives, debug and test, improve performance, and maintain software written by themselves and others. Students will have the opportunity to develop these skills by working on their own code and in group projects. There will be an emphasis on the principles of software development, style, and testing. At the end of this class, expect to be proficient in using Python to build applications, understand enough about programming to be able to quickly pick up other languages, and have a good understanding of what it takes to plan, analyze, design, implement and support software applications.</p>
